J.S. Bach: Prelude and Fugue in B-flat minor
============================================

This project aims to digitise and create annontated copies of [J.S. Bach](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach)'s Prelude and Fugue in B-flat major. In this case, _annontated_ means with voices split out, and fragments coloured.
