Source files
============
<!-- written in Markdown -->

**Note: For ease of writing, this document refers to the source files as a plural group. There may be only one, or more than one.**

This page contains information about the project's source files. These files are the basis for the Lilypond engravings, and _must_ be Public Domain or released under a free license. As the project is intended for the Public Domain, _they should be public domain whenever possible_.

The files are not commited to the Git repository, as they are currently all binary PDFs with embedded images--this would make the size too large. Instead, they are listed here with links given to their locations.

The files are given ID sequences formed of a three-letter abbreviation of their editor's surname, and the year of publication.
